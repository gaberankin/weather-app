# a stupid weather app

This is just a simple weather app that interfaces with the US government's `api.weather.gov` endpoints to gather weather information about your local area.  I did this as an excersize in front-end dev (I'm normally a back-end developer, but have a few years doing front-end work back when jQuery was _the_ popular toolkit), specifically for react and looking at tailwindcss.

Tailwind's a bit different to what I'm used to - I've used bootstrap quite a bit in the past, but I like tailwind's approach to letting the developer work out their own custom components.  I also kind of dislike that same aspect, but this is kind of a "this cake is nice to have, and I'd sure like to put it in my mouth" type situation, so I'll just ride the learning curve.
